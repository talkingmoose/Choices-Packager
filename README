Purpose

Modifying vendor-supplied Apple Installer packages (.pkg files) is bad practice. Apple's supported method for choosing which options to want to install or not install is to call a choices XML file when deploying the package via command line.

Choices Packager makes it easy for an administrator to read an Apple Installer package, such as Office 2016 for Mac, and choose which optional items to install and/or not install. It then wraps the original installer and a choices XML file in a new package that's ready for deployment.

How to use

Download the .scpt file and double-click to open in Script Editor. Or copy the text of the script into Script Editor. Save as an app to your desktop.

To create a new package, drop a vendor's original Apple Installer package onto the app and follow the prompts.


Support

This script was last tested on macOS Sonoma using Microsoft Office for Mac installer. Depending on the size of your installer, you may not see any activity for several moments, however, you should still see the app running in your dock.
